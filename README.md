# URBANMOD-ZIPF
This repository contains codes and sample data to run the urban land expansion model that preserves the zipf-law of urban cluster sizes--URBANMO-ZIPF. Detailed descriptions of this model can be found in Huang et al (2019).

## How to run URBANMOD-ZIPF
Open "main.m" in Matlab.

## Urban land areas
The areas of urban land (km^2) for each country under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are stored in "results/urban_land.csv". These areas are calculated based on the panel regression coefficients listed in the Supplementary Table 2 in Huang et al (2019). To perform the calculation, run "functions/urban_land_quantities.R" in R.

## Urban land covers in 2015
The urban land covers in 2015 are based on the Global Human Settlement Layer - Settlement Model (GHSL-SMOD; Florczyk et al 2019). Grid cells labeled as "urban center (30)" or "dense urban cluster (23)" are considered urban lands. Both of these two types of grid cells have >50% impervious surface and >1,500 people/km^2 population density. Run script "functions/urban_land_setup.R" in R to crop urban land covers in 2015 for each country. The cropped rasters are stored in "results/{country_ISO3_code}/urban_2015.tif".

## System requirements
- Matlab R2021b or above;
- RStudio v1.4.1717 or above;
- R v4.1.0 or above;
