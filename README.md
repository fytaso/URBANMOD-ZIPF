# URBANMOD-ZIPF

This repository contains codes and sample data to run the urban land expansion model, URBANMO-ZIPF, that preserves the Zipf's law size distribution of urban clusters. Detailed descriptions of this model can be found in (Huang et al 2019).

Other versions of this model can be found in (Seto et al 2012) and (Chen et al 2020). The version in (Seto et al 2012) does not preserve Zipf's law. The version in (Chen et al 2020) preserves Zipf's law and introduces a mechanism of urban shrinking.

## How to run URBANMOD-ZIPF

Open "main.m" in Matlab.

## Urban land areas in Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)

The areas of urban land (km\^2) for each country in five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are stored in "results/urban_land.csv". These areas are calculated based on the panel regression coefficients listed in the Supplementary Table 2 in (Huang et al 2019).

Run "functions/urban_land_quantities.R" in R to perform the calculation.

## Urban land covers in 2015

The urban land covers in 2015 are based on the Global Human Settlement Layer - Settlement Model (GHSL-SMOD; Florczyk et al 2019). Grid cells labeled as "urban center (30)" or "dense urban cluster (23)" are considered urban lands. Both of these two types of grid cells have \>50% impervious surface and \>1,500 people/km\^2 population density. This reporsitory only incluees setups for China, India, and United States.

Run script "functions/urban_land_setup.R" in R to crop urban land covers in 2015 for all countries. The cropped rasters are stored in "results/{country_ISO3_code}/urban_2015.tif".
