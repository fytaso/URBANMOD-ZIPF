# URBANMOD-ZIPF
This repository contains codes and sample data to run the urban land expansion model that preserves the zipf-law of urban cluster sizes--URBANMO-ZIPF. Detailed descriptions of this model can be found in Huang et al (2019).

## How to run the demo of URBANMOD-ZIPF
To run the demo provided here, open "main.m" in Matlab.

## System requirements
- Matlab R2021b or above.
- RStudio v1.4.1717 or above.
- R v4.1.0 or above.
The codes have been tested in macOS Monterey v12.01. 
Running the codes in Windows may require changing '/' to '\' for file or directory names.
