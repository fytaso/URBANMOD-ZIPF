# URBANMOD-ZIPF
This repository contains codes and sample data to run the urban land expansion model that preserves the zipf-law of urban cluster sizes--URBANMO-ZIPF. Detailed descriptions of this model can be found in Huang et al (2019).

## How to run URBANMOD-ZIPF
Open "main.m" in Matlab.

## Urban land areas
The areas of urban land (km^2) for each country under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are stored in "results/urban_land.csv". These areas are calculated based on the panel regression coefficients listed in the Supplementary Table 2 in Huang et al (2019). To perform the calculation, run "functions/urban_land_quantities.R" in R.

## System requirements
- Matlab R2021b or above;
- RStudio v1.4.1717 or above;
- R v4.1.0 or above;
